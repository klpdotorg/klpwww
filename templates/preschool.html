				<h1>Pre-school Programme<span></span></h1>
				<p class="text_1">
					In early 2000, Akshara set up its pre-school (Balwadi) programme in Bangalore. The focus was on children from underprivileged, under-served communities, with the goal of universal enrollment to primary schools. We believed that to achieve this, we needed to start with children who were not yet of formal school age. Balwadis are especially important for slum children as a preschool atmosphere of joyful learning enables the imparting of early learning and social skills which results in better school readiness.

				In Bangalore, pre-school centres are the state-run ICDS centres called anganwadis. Anganwadis are also responsible for health and nutrition but our initiative is limited to education. In Bangalore Urban there are  2065 anganawadis and we cover 1772 anganwadis with:<br/>
				TLM support <br/>
				Capacity building of workers and supervisors<br/> 
				Assessment of children and Center indicators<br/>
				BVS members training<br/><br/>

				Independent balwadis initiated by Akshara Foundation. In December 2009, there were about 110 centres. This is a self- sustaining model and is provided with training, TLM and financial assistance for the first six months; beyond that period, assistance in the form of follow up training is provided.

					Assessments are an essential part of tracking the effectiveness of the initiative and this has to be done in a non-intrusive manner. Each assessment covers aspects of child development like motor skills; cognitive skills; social and emotional skills; language skills. Assessment formats have been designed. Progress of every child will be measured - reports will however, be aggregated and distributed. Performance benchmarks by centre; by area; by project and each compared to district averages will be tracked and made available. Children have been assessed on 7 sets of competencies using 56 indicators:
				</p>
				<p>
					General Awareness <br/>
					Gross Motor Development<br/>
					Fine Motor Development<br/>
					Language Development<br/>
					Intellectual Development<br/>
					Social and Emotional Development<br/>
					Pre-academic Skills
